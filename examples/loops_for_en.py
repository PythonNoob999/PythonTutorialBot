# we make the list we want to test with

lst = [2, 6, 9, 12]

# we iterate over every number and prints it times itself

for number in lst:
    print(number*number)

# we print that the program has ended after we finish executing the for loop

print("Finished")

# OUTPUT:
#>> 4
#>> 36
#>> 81
#>> 144
